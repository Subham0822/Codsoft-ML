# Movie Genre Classification
This project is part of the Codsoft Machine Learning Internship. The goal is to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary using machine learning techniques.

## Features

-Text preprocessing with TF-IDF and word embeddings.<br>
-Classification using algorithms like:<br>
--Naive Bayes<br>
--Logistic Regression<br>
--Support Vector Machines (SVM).<br>

## Dataset
The dataset contains plot summaries of movies and their respective genres.
